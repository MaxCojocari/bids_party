# BidBlaze

Interactive bidding platform for fast and competitive auctions.

## Application Suitability

### Why microservices are a good fit?

The growing demand for bidding platform in online marketplaces, competitive pricing models, and the engaging, real-time nature of auctions, makes bidding platforms highly popular.

Implementation through distributed systems is necessary due to following reasons:

#### Scalability

Microservices allow key components, like bid processing, to scale independently during traffic spikes, especially near auction endings.

#### Modularity

By decoupling functions like user authentication, auction management, and real-time notifications into separate services, we enhance maintainability and enable teams to work independently.

#### Maintainability

Microservices reduce the complexity of maintaining large monolithic bidding system by breaking entities into smaller, focused services.

#### Deployment & Fault Isolation

Failures in one service donâ€™t affect others. Services can be updated or deployed separately for faster development without disrupting the entire system.

### Real-world example: eBay

eBay's bidding platform lets sellers list items and buyers place bids. Transitioning to microservices enabled them to handle high bid volumes, support millions of users, and maintain the system with ease.
