# BidBlaze

Interactive bidding platform for fast and competitive auctions.

## Application Suitability

### Why microservices are a good fit?

The growing demand for bidding platform in online marketplaces, competitive pricing models, and the engaging, real-time nature of auctions, makes bidding platforms highly popular.

Implementation through distributed systems is necessary due to following reasons:

- **Scalability**: Microservices allow key components, like bid processing, to scale independently during traffic spikes, especially near auction endings.

- **Modularity**: By decoupling functions like bidding and auctions handling into separate services, we enhance maintainability and enable teams to work independently.

- **Maintainability**: Microservices reduce the complexity of maintaining large monolithic bidding system by breaking entities into smaller, focused services.

- **Deployment & Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect others. Services can be updated or deployed separately for faster development without disrupting the entire system.

### Real-world example: eBay

eBay's bidding platform lets sellers list items and buyers place bids. Transitioning to microservices enabled them to handle high bid volumes, support millions of users, and maintain the system with ease.

## Service Boundaries

- **Auction Service**: Handles backend logic for managing auctions, processing bids, and ensuring the auction process runs correctly.

- **Bidder Service**: Manages bidder interactions, including placing bids, receiving real-time auction updates, and tracking bid-related activities.

- **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing traffic to the appropriate microservices.

- **Service Discovery**: Keeps track of available services and their instances to allow the API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate instances.

## Deployment & Scaling

Each service, including

- Auction Service
- Bidder Service
- API Gateway (Nginx)
- Service Discovery (Consul)

will be deployed as Docker containers within a shared network managed by Docker Compose. Redis and Postgres will also run as containerized services.

Each custom service is defined with its own **Dockerfile**, ensuring that dependencies are packaged and the service runs consistently across environments.

Horizontal scaling will be applied, allowing multiple instances of each service to be deployed for load balancing and better performance.

All services are managed through a single `docker-compose.yml` file, simplifying configuration and communication. To deploy and scale the services, I will use:

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This builds each service from its Dockerfile and launches them in detached mode with horizontal scaling.
